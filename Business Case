Executive Summary:
The Digital-First for Annuity goal is to increase the net new number of financial professionals wanting to understand, transact, and manage annuities. This project will focus on the 93% of financial professionals that are not meaningfully transacting annuities. To do that, the industry needs to enable financial professionals to report annuity income in the tools that they are using for portfolio management, wealth management, the brokerage account. 
The industry needs to create a standardized, easy, way for reporting current and future income from annuities, which will allow any tool to seamlessly integrate annuity income projections into their comprehensive portfolio reports without requiring in-depth product knowledge, mapping, or complex calculations. 
Problem:
Financial advisors face significant challenges presenting annuity income to their consumers in the same tool where their other products are managed. These challenges are due to… 
•	Current inability to see activated income alongside traditional investments
•	Current inability to see available income alongside traditional investments
•	Current inability to run long-term annuity income projections, preventing directionally accurate long-term income planning. 
•	Custom work by carrier and by product is often required to support annuity products, creating barriers to integrating. 
•	Lack of standardization across different annuity products and carriers creates barriers to integration. 
•	Complexity of calculations, that very by carrier and product, creating barriers to integration. 

These barriers create missed financial planning and reporting opportunities, reducing advisors' ability to recommend annuities effectively or even manage the annuity (activation of riders, etc) or manage the consumer’s income planning discussions. Without visibility into annuity income, advisors are less likely to recommend annuities, despite their value. 


Use Cases

Day1 Use Case 1: A portfolio management and reporting tool can be used for accurate income planning where the annuity short-term income (12 months) has been activated for inforce policies.  This use case shows baseline income to provide the near-accurate income for the next rolling 12 months including income that has started (income rider activated) or the contract has been annuitized . 

User Story 1: As a financial advisor, I want to get a snapshot in time in my portfolio tool for near-accurate income planning that includes the inforce annuity to present a comprehensive look at activated income on the annuity over the next 12 months (rolling). 

- Must know the payment schedule: last payment, amount of last payment and frequency. That number will be replicated for the frequency to get a near-accurate view of the income as it is known at that time. (see below feed back from FPs)
- Must have an indicator if that payment amount is gross of taxes or net of taxes (either is fine but it needs to be disclosed)
- Nice to have: important dates related to the contract like when a step up or anniversary is eligible. 
- There is a need for single requests as well as bulk requests. 
- Parameters to control the request (by firm, agent, contract list, etc)
-	The bulk method lives alongside a synchronous response such that the API will define batch / asynchronous and the parameters; or single synchronous and the parameters. This way the methods are reusing components. 

Implementor notes: Nice to have: Separate guaranteed income/secure income from non-guaranteed/other income so the annuity is seen as a differentiator
Nice to have: visual indicator in the 12 month timeline if a step up or anniversary is eligible. Only possible if that data is passed. (optional)
